# Heterogeneous Parallel Computing

For basically all the 21st century two trends have dominated the area of High Perfomance Computing. The first one is the increase number of cores in CPUs from the dual core to the current CPUs on consumer market with 4, 8 and more cores. The second trend is the availability of modern coprocessors.

Coprocessors are devices that take some processing out of the CPU by specializing on specific tasks. Those coprocessors have not all the capabilities of CPUs and in general are not able to act as a CPU but they are very efficient in certain tasks. Examples of coprocessors in recent years are the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors and most notoriously for this lesson GPUs in particular those from NVIDIA that thanks to CUDA we will examine in these series of lectures.

These trends will most likely follow and enhance in the foreseeable future. CPUs will come with 20, 40 and even more cores per socket. GPUs will become more common in addition to another specialized coprocessors such as FPGAs, and neural processors.

In this lesson we will concentrate on parallel computing with CUDA and OpenACC.
The central theme about using GPUs is to manage a large number of computing threads a number that is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude larger than the number of computing threads on CPUs. In contrast to what is called *multithreading parallel computing*, on GPUs we talk about *many-threading parallel computing*.

The first GPUs used for general computing, came from repurposing GPUs.
GPUs were originally designed to compute textures, graphics and rotations of 3D graphics for display on screen. These tasks do not require for most part double precision numbers. Only relatively recently double precision capabilities were integrated in those GPUs but for most part significant performance edge can be achieved when you can work with single precision floats.

Memory bandwidth is another important constrainer in GPUs. As GPUs have their own memory and cannot manage the central RAM, the ability to perform better on a GPU depends on enough processing being done with the data allocated on the GPU memory before the data is copied back to the Host RAM. A GPU must be capable of transferring large amounts of data, processing the data for a meaningful mount of time and return the results back in order to produce a positive return.

As such GPUs were designed for very specific tasks and not all tasks can be efficiently being offloaded to the GPU. There are tasks for which CPUs perform better and will continue to do so in the near future. At the end we will have what we called **heterogeneous parallel computing** a paradigm where parallel computing is exploited at 3 different and even entangled levels.

First is CPU multithreading execution. In the next lesson we will demonstrate one example of OpenMP a popular model for these kind of parallelism. In CPU multithreading we use the ability of modern CPUs to have several cores that see the same memory. The next level is coprocessor parallelism, exemplified with OpenACC, OpenCL and CUDA. Using for example GPUs certain tasks what require many threads with relatively small amount of memory can be processed on those devices and get an advantage from them. The final level is distributed computing with a prototypical case is MPI. We will demonstrate a brief example of MPI in the next lesson but it is out of scope for this workshop.

## Accelerators (like GPUs) in the world largest supercomputers

NVIDIA GPUs Powered 168 of The Top500 Supercomputers On The Planet.
Eight of the worldâ€™s top 10 supercomputers now use NVIDIA GPUs, InfiniBand networking or both. They include the most powerful systems in the U.S., Europe and China.
The fastest supercomputers all rely on Accelerators.
More than 50% of the computational power in the top500 comes from accelerators.

As per the latest figures, it looks like NVIDIA GPUs are powering the bulk of the supercomputers in the Top500 list with a total of 168 systems while AMD's CPUs and GPUs power a total of 121 supercomputers. At the same time, Supercomputers housing AMD and NVIDIA GPU-based accelerators are largely running Intel CPUs which cover around 400 supercomputers and that's a huge figure & while the number of systems running Intel CPUs are in a clear lead in quantity, AMD actually wins the crown for the fastest supercomputer around in the form of Frontier.

## Launching interactive sessions with GPUs

A very simple way of launching an interactive job is using the command ``srun``:
The following is an example of a request for an interactive job asking for 1 GPU 8 CPU cores for 2 hours:

	trcis001:~$ srun -p comm_gpu_inter -G 1 -t 2:00:00 -c 8 --pty bash

You can verify the assigned GPU using the command nvidia-smi:

	trcis001:~$ srun -p comm_gpu_inter -G 1 -t 2:00:00 -c 8 --pty bash
	srun: job 22599 queued and waiting for resources
	srun: job 22599 has been allocated resources
